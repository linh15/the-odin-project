1. Version Control System
3 types: local (local computer), centralized (central server to different computers) and distributed (Git - server computer vs other computers)
Git: all clients mirror the whole repository and its history => if a server dies, any client repository can be copied back up to server to restore


2. What is Git?
- Every time you commit, Git takes a picture of all the files at that moment and stores a reference to this snapshot
=> data = stream of snapshots

- Most operations are local, all history of the project is on your local disk => faster, no need constant network connection

- Git only adds data, after a snapshot is committed to Git => very difficult to lose

- 3 main states that files can live in:
modified: changed the file but not committed to local database yet
staged: marked a modified file in its current version 
committed: data is safely stored in the local database
