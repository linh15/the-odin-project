- HTML: how the webpage is structured
defines the semantic structure of a document, nothing about visual representation
headline tags help auto-generate a table of contents for the document
- CSS: how the page looks
- JavaScript: how the page functions


*** Get started with the web
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/Dealing_with_files
- Deal with files 
store files for one website project in one folder
name the files in lowcases (avoid case sensitive situations)
separate words with hyphens, not underscores, no space: my-website
- A website project: a folder with the following elements 
1. index.html => homepage content
2. images folder => all images
3. style folder => CSS code to style contents
4. scripts folder => JavaScript code to add interactive functions to the website


*** HTML basics (Hypertext Markup Language)
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics
1. What it is and its anatomy
- Consists of elements, each element wraps different parts of the content to make it appear or act in a certain way
- An element (3 parts): opening tag, content and closing tag 
eg: <p>My cat is sleeping</p>
can also contain an attribute (extra info that doesn't appear in the content) = name (class) + value ("editor-note")
eg: <p class="editor-note">My cat is sleeping</p>
- Nest element 2 in element 1
opening tag 1 => opening tag 2 => closing tag 2 => closing tag 1
- empty element: doesn't wrap content, no closing tag

2. Images 
- <img> element embeds an image into the page in the position it appears
eg: <img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="The Firefox logo: a flaming fox surrounding the Earth.">
- it has 2 attributes: 
src (source) = the path to the image file
alt (alternative) = descriptive text (for visually impaired people or for when the source is changed/incorrect)

3. Marking up the text: essential HTML elements
- Headings and subheadings: 6 levels <h1> â€“ <h6>
- Paragraphs: <p> </p>
- Lists: each item inside (list item) <li>
Unordered (order doesn't matter): <u1>
Ordered (order matters): <o1>

4. Links
add a link <a> (anchor)
href attribute (hypertext reference): web address of the link
eg: <a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a>


*** CSS basics (Cascading Style Sheets)
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/CSS_basics
1. What it is 
- a style sheet language, used to style the elements of HTML
- contains sets of rules
- structure
eg: 
p {
    color: red;
    width: 500px;
}
p = selector => HTML element name to be styled
{} wrap 1 rule set
color: red = declaration => declare 1 rule
color = property of an HTML element
red = property value
; => separate each declaration

2. Fonts and text
Anything in CSS between /* and */ is a CSS comment
3. Box model
padding, the space around the content. In the example below, it is the space around the paragraph text.
border, the solid line that is just outside the padding.
margin, the space around the outside of the border.

*** JavaScript basics 
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics
1. What it is 
-  full-fledged dynamic programming language that can add interactivity to a website
2. Language crash course 
Variables
Comments
Operators
Conditionals
Functions
Events
3. Example website
Image changer
Personalized welcome message
