# 5. Problem solving
- Problem solving is the core thing software developers do. The programming languages and tools they use are secondary to this fundamental skill.
      “Problem solving is writing an original program that performs a particular set of tasks and meets all stated constraints.” - Think Like a Programmer - V. Anton Spraul

  + The set of tasks can range from solving small coding exercises all the way up to building a social network site like Facebook or a search engine like Google. Each problem has its own set of constraints, for example, high performance and scalability may not matter too much in a coding exercise but it will be vital in apps like Google that need to service billions of search queries each day.

  + The best way to improve your problem solving ability is by building experience by making lots and lots of programs. The more practice you have the better you’ll be prepared to solve real world problems.

- Problem solving process:
  + Understand the Problem: understand exactly what the problem is.
        - Don’t understand the problem:
              -> won’t know when you’ve successfully solved it
              -> may waste a lot of time on a wrong solution
        - To gain clarity and understanding of the problem:
              -> write it down on paper
              -> reword it in plain English until it makes sense to you
              -> draw diagrams if that helps.
              -> When you can explain the problem to someone else in plain English, you understand it.
  + Plan: plan out how you’re going to solve the problem
        - Ask some questions:
              -> User interface? If yes, how? What functionality? -> Sketch this on paper
              -> What inputs? Data from user input or from somewhere else?
              -> Desired output?
              -> Given inputs -> what steps needed to return the desired output?
        - Write out an algorithm to solve the problem: a recipe for solving a particular problem -> defines the steps that need to be taken by the computer to solve a problem in pseudo code.

  + Pseudo code: write out the logic for your program in natural language instead of code => slow down and think through the steps your program will have to go through to solve the problem

  + Divide and conquer:
        - Break the big problem down
        - Solve each of the smaller problems until you’ve solved the big problem, starting with the simplest

  + Debug: Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong. Programmers call this debugging (in fact, this is all a debugger does).
  + Reassess: Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective. Is there anything that can be abstracted to a more general approach? Another way of reassessing is starting anew. Delete everything and begin again with fresh eyes.
  + Research: Ahh, good ol’ Google. You read that right. No matter what problem you have, someone has probably solved it. Find that person/ solution. In fact, do this even if you solved the problem! (You can learn a lot from other people’s solutions). Don’t look for a solution to the big problem. Only look for solutions to sub-problems. No struggle => no learning => waste time.

- Practice:  If you want to be a good problem-solver, solve a lot of problems! How to practice? There are options out the wazoo! Chess puzzles, math problems, Sudoku, Go, Monopoly, video-games, cryptokitties, bla… bla… bla…. What you should do is find an outlet to practice. Something that allows you to solve many micro-problems (ideally, something you enjoy). For example, I enjoy coding challenges. Every day, I try to solve at least one challenge (usually on Coderbyte). Like I said, all problems share similar patterns.

      + "You need to learn to be as mind-numbingly stupid as a computer"
      + "The secret isn't code, the secret is algorithms and data"
      + What I wish I'd been taught:
            + Programming isn't about languages, they ultimately don't matter
            + Not a lot of memorizing
            + Most programming isn't about math
            + Programming languages are simpler than human languages
            + Programming is really about solving problems
            + Programming is explaining things to the stupid computer
      + Coding isn't about language, it has about 8 concepts
            + They work in almost the same way in every languages
            + Learn how to use these concepts in English
            + Write out the concept first and then convert to code later
            + Most beginners think they don't understand what code to write
            + Real problem: they don't really understand the problem they're trying to solve
      + Comments are code:
            + Comments explain code to other programmers and yourself
            + Code explains comments to the computer
      + Failure is wonderful:
            + Normal part of programming
            + Debugging: did you tell it what to do incorrectly (implementation problem) or did you tell it the wrong thing (algorithm problem)
            + Most beginners assume implementation problem while it's usually algorithm problem
      + How to debug:
            + What are you not understanding?
            + What tools can you use?
            + Don't start with a solution, start by truly understanding the problem
            + Bad implementation can be googled, bad algorithm usually cannot
