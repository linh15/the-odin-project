1. Git basic workflow
- Create a repository on Github
- Clone the repo to my local computer
- Create a new file / make changes (modified state)
- $ git add file => add file to staging area in Git (staging state)
- $ git commit -m "message" => commit the file (commited satate)

2. Common lines
- add all file in the current repository
$ git add .

- check the status of the current repo
$ git status

- check commit history
$ git log

- upload the work to Github
$ git push 

*** origin vs master/main
- origin = the remote repo to push the work
- master/main = your current local branch to push to origin
