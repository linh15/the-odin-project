### Build Google Homepage with more (fun) features using more CSS tools and JavaScript

## To-do list / Ideas
- Top navbar: change text font, add Google apps and account images
- Search and by voice icons:
+ find better icons that look more like the original ones  
+ treat search by voice as a button to be hovered and clicked
+ apply Flexbox or Grid to corporate them with the search background
- I'm Feeling Lucky button: find a way to shuffle them for other phrases
- Footer: add click function for Settings, find out the right color for background, remove the white bar on the bottom of the page
- Google logo: replace with a funny gorilla
- Clicks: create alerts when the click doesn't go anywhere
